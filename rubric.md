## Project Workflow
Does not meet expectations. It may in large part be due to pivoting on Tuesday. But the user stories you wrote does not apply to the project that you built. This bullet isn't super important for Project 1 either...

## Technical Requirements
Meets expectations. Good job on getting the logic of trivia to work. I think you have a solid understanding of DOM manipulation. There are definitely a lot of refactoring opportunities and I encourage you to poke through my comments and your code and see what you can do.

## Code Quality
Meets Expectations. Code looks properly indented. Think you went a little bit overboard on your variable declarations. Remember to get rid of any extra code you aren't using. Comments are always great. Good job

## Problem Solving
Trivia was solved just fine! Even though its a relatively simple concept, I think there evidence of understanding in the materials we've covered in the first two weeks.

## overall
Good job Jared. Theres always refactoring opportunities. I think the biggest one is to convert those arrays in your probgram into objects. Great work.
